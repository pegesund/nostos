# I/O Handle Types
#
# These types provide type safety for I/O operations.
# Each handle type wraps an Int but they are not interchangeable.

# File handle for open file operations
pub type FileHandle = FileHandle(Int)

# Server handle for HTTP server
pub type ServerHandle = ServerHandle(Int)

# Request ID for HTTP server responses
pub type RequestId = RequestId(Int)

# Process handle for spawned external processes
pub type ProcessHandle = ProcessHandle(Int)
